Branches are very helpful with protecting the main code. You can allow copies of the code on peoples machine and allow for them to modify it without concern of damaging the initial code. And when you want to actually update the code you are able to just push the code into the project, either by overriding or by adding. It also has version control so that you are able to go back to an alternate version in case you want to do a rollback. This whole process makes it a ton easier to actually understand what the main code is, even if changes occurred to it.
